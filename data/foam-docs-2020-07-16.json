Established product with a paid plan, so may not be open to Foam-supportive changes and additions that don't benefit most users.\n\nVerdict: Good. By far best effort/outcome ratio would be to help improve GitJournal rather than building a [bespoke mobile app](#bespoke-mobile-app-for-foam).\n\n## Bespoke mobile app for Foam\n\nGiven we already have a solution, why would we spend time and effort building a bespoke mobile app?\n\n- Taking notes on the go is a key part of a good note taking process, and the process should feel effortless\n- Having a custom app could help us support key user workflows in a more Foam-specific manner\n\nIf such an app was worth building, it would have to have the following features:\n\n- Instant loading and syncing for quick notes\n- Sleek, simple, beautifully designed user experience.\n- Ability to search and navigate forward links and back links (onlly in paid GitJournal version)\n- Killer feature that makes it the best note taking tool for Foam (?)\n\nGiven the effort vs reward ratio, it's a low priority for core team, but if someone wants to work on this, we can provide support!

Focused, interoperable modules are better, because they allow users to pick and mix which features work for them. A good example of why this matters is the Markdown All In One extension we rely on: While it provides many of the things we need, a few of its features are incompatible with how I would like to work, and therefore it becomes a limiter of how well I can improve my own workflow.\n\nHowever, there becomes a point where we may benefit from implementing a centralised solution, e.g. a syntax, an extension or perhaps a VSCode language server. As much as possible, we should allow users to operate in a decentralised manner.\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[referencing-notes-by-title]: referencing-notes-by-title \"Referencing notes by title\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n",

This isn't sufficient, because:\n\n- For e.g. [[materialized-backlinks]] to work, files need to update in the background.\n  - Separation of clean vs generated workspace for publishing?\n  - Support for standard markdown tools\n    - Output to a /build directory\n    - Would have to implement a custom previewer\n    - [[todo]] **Janne Ojanaho! Write a short proposal for this.**\n- If VS Code extension bugs our or is not ran, the workspace can lead in an inconsistent state\n- In collaboration scenarios, two people may change the same file, causing incomplete updates\n- If someone pushes changes from outside VS Code (Obsidian, Git Journal, etc.) links aren't updated\n\n## Proposal\n\nImplement a note janitor (working title, named after Andy Matuschak's [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor)), which ensures all files are correctly linked and updated, no matter how changes happen.\n\nJanitor should be runnable:\n\n- From VS Code\n  - Replaces the existing logic in extension.ts\n  - In theory, we could do this using the [VS Code Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks), exposing it from foam-vscode with a [TaskProvider](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/task-provider)\n  - It's not clear to me whether modifying the file in the active VS Code buffer from a background task is problematic for e.g. focus/selection management. I think this is how e.g. Prettier works, but not sure if there's some special case for the active editor.\n  - VS Code provides its own workspace watching functionality. Not sure it would be beneficial to use this over just chokidar-style file watching in the background\n- As a pre-push Git Hook (is this a good idea?) to ensure we send fully formed note graphs, even if you had to do some editing outside vs code\n- As a GitHub Action (for incoming changes via PRs and other apps like GitJournal)\n  - Run the \"build\" and push back to master/gh-pages\n- As a NPM script/dependency for any other purpose\n\n## Software architecture\n\n- It's not really clear to me whether the workspace janitor should be its own package, or if the Janitor should just be the [[cli]] package, or the [[foam-core]] package.\n- Ideally the janitor should be lightweight so installing it on CI is quick\n- It would be cool if it didn't have many weird node-specific dependencies, maybe it could be even ran INSIDE a mobile application?\n- We don't want to pollute foam-core, but janitor might actually get quite diverse in use cases.\n\nDecoupling things like the core janitor API from the CLI API would help potentially with situations where we might want to have a separate file watcher strategy for CLI and active VS Code workspaces (see above).\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[wiki-links]: wiki-links \"Wiki Links\"\n[materialized-backlinks]: materialized-backlinks \"Materialized Backlinks (stub)\"\n[cli]: cli \"Command Line Interface\"\n[foam-core]: foam-core \"Foam Core\"\n[todo]: todo \"Todo\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n",

This is done to make the content of the file compatible with various Markdown tools (e.g. parsers, static site generators, VS code plugins etc), which don't support `[[wiki-links]]`.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example:\n  ```md\n  - [[wiki-links]]\n  - [[github-pages]]\n  ```\n...generates the following link reference definitions to the bottom of the file:\n  ```md\n  [wiki-links]: wiki-links \"Wiki Links\"\n  [github-pages]: github-pages \"Github Pages\"\n  ```\nYou can open the [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foambubble/foam/master/foam-file-format.md) to see them at the bottom of this file\n\n## Specification\n\nThe three components of a link reference definition are `[link-label]: link-target \"Link Title\"`\n\n- **link label:** The link text to match in the surrounding markdown document. This matches the inner bracket of the double-bracketed `[[wiki-link]]` notation\n- **link destination** The target of the matched link\n  - Right now we generate link destinations without file extension. This is a choice, see [discussion here](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wiki-links#why-dont-wiki-links-work-on-github).\n- **\"Link Title\"** Optional title for link (The Foam template has a snippet of JavaScript to replace this on the website at runtime)\n\nSee [[link-reference-definition-improvements]] for further discussion on current problems and potential solutions.\n\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[wiki-links]: wiki-links \"Wiki Links\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap \"Roadmap\"\n[link-reference-definition-improvements]: link-reference-definition-improvements \"Link Reference Definition Improvements\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"",

      "source": "# Link Reference Definition Improvements\n\n## Current Problems\n\n### File-by-file Insertion\n\nFor the time being, if you want to get [[wiki-links]] into all files within the workspace, you'll need to generate the link reference definitions yourself file-by-file (with the assistance of Foam).\n\n### Wikilinks don't work on GitHub\n\n> **TL;DR;** [workaround](#workaround) in the end of the chapter.\n\nIf you click any of the wiki-links on GitHub web UI (such as the `README.md` of a project), you'll notice that the links break with a 404 error.\n\nAt the time of writing (June 28 2020) this is a known, but unsolved error. To understand why this is the case, we need to understand what we are trading off.\n\nSo, why don't they work on GitHub?\n\nThe three components of [[link-reference-definitions]] are link label, link destination and Link Title.\n\nThe issue is the middle **link destination** component. It's configured to point to the file name **without file extension**, i.e. \"file-name\" instead of \"file-name.md\". This is to make the GitHub Pages rendering work, because if we generated the links to `file-name.md`, the links would point to the raw markdown files instead of their generated HTML versions.\n\n| Environment      | `file-name` | `file-name.md` |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| **VS Code**      | Works       | Works          |\n| **GitHub pages** | Works       | Breaks         |\n| **GitHub UI**    | Breaks      | Works          |\n\nSo as you can see, we've prioritised GitHub Pages over GitHub Web UI for the time being.\n\nIdeally, we'd like a solution that works with both, but it's not defined yet (see [[link-reference-definitions]] for more details)\n\n#### Workaround\n\nFor the time being, you can use relative `[markdown links](markdown-link.md)` syntax.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- This will work on all platforms.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- It will break the Markdown Notes [[backlinking]] support\n- Less convenient to write\n\n### Finding certain words clutter the VS Code search results\n\nSince link reference definitions have `[//begin]` and `[//end]` guards with explanatory text that use certain words, these words (like \"generate\") appear in VS Code search results if you happen to search matching strings from the workspace.\n\n## Improvement Proposal\n\nProblem space in essence:\n\n- During edit-time (when modifying the markdown files in an editor)\n  - link reference definitions are needed if user uses editor extensions that don't understand wikilinks\n  - link reference definitions may be annoying since they \n    - add content to files that the user hasn't typed in by themselves\n    - get out of date if user uses a tool that doesn't autogenerate them\n    - may clutter the search results\n- During build-time (when converting markdown to html for publishing purposes)\n  - link reference definitions are needed, if the files are published via such tools (or to such platforms) that don't understand wikilinks\n  - link reference definitions might have to be in different formats depending on the publish target (e.g. Github pages vs Github UI)\n\nThe potential solution:\n\n- For edit-time\n  - Make edit-time link reference definition generation optional via user settings. They should be on by default, and generating valid markdown links with a relative path to a `.md` file.\n  - Make format of the link reference definition configurable (whether to include '.md' or not)\n  - Out of recommended extensions, currently only \"markdown links\" doesn't support them (?). However even its [code](https://github.com/tchayen/markdown-links/blob/master/src/parsing.ts#L25) seems to include wikilink parser, so it might just be a bug?\n- For build-time\n  - To satisfy mutually incompatible constraints between GitHub UI, VSCode UI, and GitHub Pages, we should add a pre-processing/build step for pushing to GitHub Pages. \n    - This would be a GitHub action (or a local script, ran via foam-cli) that outputs publish-friendly markdown format for static site generators and other publishing tools\n    - This build step should be pluggable, so that other transformations could be ran during it\n  - Have publish targets defined in settings, that support both turning the link reference definitions on/off and defining their format (.md or not). Example draft (including also edit-time aspect):\n    ```typescript\n    // settings json\n    // see enumerations below for explanations on values\n    {\n      \"foam\": {\n        \"publish\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Gitlab Mirror\",     // name of the publish target\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"Off\",\n            \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withExtensions\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"GitHub Pages\",\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"Off\",\n            \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withoutExtensions\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Blog\",\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"Off\",\n            \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"Off\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"My Amazing PDF book\",\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"WikiLinksToMarkdown\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"edit\": {\n          \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"Off\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Defines if and how links in markdown files are somehow converted (in-place) during build time\n    // Note that this enumeration is not valid edit-time, since we (probably) don't want to change text like this while user is editing it\n    enum LinkTranspilation {\n      Off,                   // links are not transpiled\n      WikiLinksToMarkdown,   // links using wiki-format [[link]] are converted to normal md links: [link](./some/file.md)\n                             // if this is set, not link reference definitions are generated (not needed)\n    }\n    \n    // Defines if and how link reference definition section is generated\n    enum LinkReferenceDefinitions {\n      Off,               // link reference definitions are not generated\n      WithExtensions,    // link reference definitions contain .md (or similar) file extensions\n      WithoutExtensions  // link reference definitions do not contain file extenions\n    }\n\n    ```\n  - With Foam repo, just use edit-time link reference definitions with '.md' extension - this makes the links work in the Github UI\n  - Have publish target defined for Github pages, that doesn't use '.md' extension, but still has the link reference definitions. Generate the output into gh-pages branch (or separate repo) with automation.\n    - This naturally requires first removing the existing link reference definitions during the build\n- Other\n  - To clean up the search results, remove link reference definition section guards (assuming that these are not defined by the markdown spec). Use unifiedjs parse trees to identify if there's missing (or surplus) definitions (check if they are identified properly by the library), and just add the needed definitions to the bottom of the file (without guards) AND remove them if they are not needed (anywhere from the file).\n\nNote that the proposal above supports both (build-time) inline transpilation of wikilinks as well as creation reference definitions. Depending on the direction of Foam, also only one of them could be selected. In that case the other could be implemented at later point of time.\n\nUI-wise, the publish targets could be picked in some similar fashion as the run/debug targets in vscode by implementing a separate panel, or maybe through command execution (CTRL+SHIFT+P) - not yet defined at this point.\n\n## Links\n\n- [tracking issue on GitHub](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/16)\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[wiki-links]: wiki-links \"Wiki Links\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap \"Roadmap\"\n[link-reference-definitions]: link-reference-definitions \"Link Reference Definitions\"\n[backlinking]: backlinking \"Backlinking\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n",

There must be no tight coupling between Foam's features.\n- **Foam is a starting point** You must be able to customise how foam looks and feels, and combine it with other tools you find helpful in your personal workflow.\n- **Foam is not a philosophy.** Whether you use a methodology like Zettelkasten is up to you. **You should be able to use Foam without joining a cult.**\n\n## Foam wants you to own your thoughts\n\n- **Foam doesn't want your data.** You can store your documents wherever you want. Some of Foam's suggested workflows include GitHub, if you don't want to use it to store your data, or you want to stop using it in the future, you should be able to migrate to alternative storage options. If you choose to not upload your notes to any cloud service or remote repository, remember to keep frequent local and occasional offsite backups of your data!\n- **Foam should not lock you in.** Foam's content files, structure and metadata should be in interoperable format that supports migrating it to another tool if you prefer to. Users of Foam should be able to develop and share such tools freely.\n- **Foam should not leak your secrets.** Nobody, including the developers of Foam, should have access to your personal knowledge graph unless you choose to give it to them. Foams should always be private by default, but [easy to share](#foam-helps-you-share-your-thoughts-with-the-world) if you choose to.\n\n## Foam helps you share your thoughts with the world.\n\nThis principle may seem like it contradicts [Foam wants you to own your thoughts](#foam-wants-you-to-own-your-thoughts), but it's actually a compatible corollary. You should be able to do both, because:\n\n> [...] environments that build walls around good ideas tend to be less innovative in the long run than more open-ended environments. Good ideas may not want to be free, but they do want to connect, fuse, recombine. —_Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From_\n\n- **Foam should make it easy to publish your knowledge graph.** With zero code, you should be able to make your graph public to the world. You should have full control over how it looks, feels, and where it's hosted.\n- **Foam should make it easy to collaborate on ideas.** Foam should allow you to work closely together with your collaborators, and accept feedback, input and improvements from others. _(Work in progress, see [[roadmap]]_.\n- **Foam should make it easy to publish what you choose.** Foam should double as a low-barrier blog/publishing platform, so you can share content to an audience without inviting them to intrude on your entire workspace. _(Work in progress, see [[roadmap]]_.\n\n## Foam allows people to collaborate in discovering better ways to work, together.\n\n- **Foam is a collection of ideas.** Foam was released to the public not to share the few good ideas in it, but to learn many good ideas from others. As you improve your own workflow, share your work on your own Foam blog.\n- **Foam is open for contributions.** If you use a tool or workflow that you like that fits these principles, please contribute them back to the Foam template as [[recipes]], [[recommended-extensions]] or documentation in [this workspace](httpsL//github,com/foambubble/foam). See also: [[roadmap]] and [[contribution-guide]].\n- **Foam is open source.** Feel free to fork it, improve it and remix it. Just don't sell it, as per our [license](license).\n- **Foam is not Roam.** This project was inspired by Roam Research, but we're not limited by what Roam does. No idea is too big (though if it doesn't fit with Foam's core workflow, we might make it a [[recipes]] page instead).\n\n## Foam is for hackers, not only for programmers\n\nWhile Foam uses tools popular among computer programmers, Foam should be inclusive of everyone who wants to improve their own workflow to improve themselves.\n\n- **Foam embraces the hacker mindset.** The target audience for Foam are people who look for creative ways to improve their ability to collect and organise information.\n- **Foam is not just for programmers.** If you're a programmer, feel free to write scripts and extensions to support your own workflow, and publish them for others to use, but the out of the box Foam experience should not require you to know how to do so. You should, however, be curious and open to adopting new tools that are unfamiliar to you, and evaluate whether they could work for you.\n- **Foam is for everyone** As a foam user, you support everyone's quest for knowledge and self-improvement, not only your own, or folks' who look like you. All participants in Foam repositories, discussion forums, physical and virtual meeting spaces etc are expected to respect each other as described in our [[code-of-conduct]]. **Foam is not for toxic tech bros.**\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap \"Roadmap\"\n[recipes]: recipes \"Recipes\"\n[recommended-extensions]: recommended-extensions \"Recommended Extensions\"\n[contribution-guide]: contribution-guide \"Contribution Guide\"\n[code-of-conduct]: code-of-conduct \"Code of Conduct\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n",

Here are some general tips on how to get started on contributing to Foam:\n\n- Use Foam for yourself, figure out what could be improved.\n- Check out [[roadmap]] to see what's already in the plans. I have thoughts about how to implement some of these, but open to ideas and code contributions!\n- Read about our [[principles]] to understand Foam's philosophy and direction\n- Read and act in accordance of our [[code-of-conduct]].\n- Feel free to open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) to give me feedback and ideas for new features.\n- Foam code and documentation live in the monorepo at [foambubble/foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/)\n  - [/docs](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/docs): documentation and [[recipes]]\n  - [/packages/foam-vscode](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/tree/master/packages/foam-vscode): the core VSCode plugin\n  - [/packages/foam-core](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/tree/master/packages/foam-core): powers the core functionality in Foam across all platforms\n- Exceptions to the monorepo are:\n  - The starter template at [foambubble/foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/)\n  - All other [[recommended-extensions]] live in their respective GitHub repos.\n\n## Contributing to the VS Code Extension\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the VS Code extension (aka `foam-vscode`), this guide will help you get things set up locally.\n\n1. Clone the repo locally:\n\n   `git clone https://github.com/foambubble/foam.git`\n\n2. Install the necessary dependencies by running this command from the root:\n\n   `yarn install`\n\n3. This project uses [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).`foam-vscode` relies on `foam-core`. This means we need to compile it before we do any extension development. From the root, run the command:\n\n   `yarn workspace foam-core build`\n\n4. Now we'll use the launch configuration defined at [`.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/.vscode/launch.json) to start a new extension host of VS Code. From the root, or the `foam-vscode` workspace, press f5.\n5. In the new extension host of VS Code that launched, open a Foam workspace (e.g. your personal one, or a test-specific one created from foam-template). This is strictly not necessary, but the extension won't auto-run unless it's in a workspace with a `.vscode/foam.json` file.\n6. Test a command to make sure it's working as expected. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and select \"Foam: Update Markdown Reference List\". If you see no errors, it's good to go!\n\nFor more resources related to the VS Code Extension, check out the links below:\n\n- [[tutorial-adding-a-new-command-to-the-vs-code-extension]]\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[todo]: todo \"Todo\"\n[good-first-task]: good-first-task \"Good First Task\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap \"Roadmap\"\n[principles]: principles \"Principles\"\n[code-of-conduct]: code-of-conduct \"Code of Conduct\"\n[recipes]: recipes \"Recipes\"\n[recommended-extensions]: recommended-extensions \"Recommended Extensions\"\n[tutorial-adding-a-new-command-to-the-vs-code-extension]: tutorial-adding-a-new-command-to-the-vs-code-extension \"Tutorial: Adding a New Command to the VS Code Extension\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n",

As the graph grows, you should be able to visualise where an idea belongs. Maybe a literal map? And island? A DeckGL visualisation?\n- Write about the history and process of Foam\n  - In ways, Wallet was the first iteration of Foam-like environment\n- Should we support directories?\n  - Some tools might get more complicated to build\n  - The pressure to categorize and create hierachies can become distracting\n  - Is there value in folderizing?\n  - Use case: Writing docs in a codebase\n\nTesting: This file is served from the /docs directory.\n\n\n",

The first paragraph or two should explain the purpose of the recipe succinctly, including why it's useful, if that's not obvious.\n\nRecipes are intended to document:\n- How to use Foam's basic features\n- Power user pro-tips\n- Useful customisations of the default Foam environment\n- Integrations with third party tools and extensions (should be listed below)\n\n## Required Extensions\n\n - **[Hacker Typer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jevakallio.vscode-hacker-typer)** (not really required for this recipe, just an example)\n - [Foam for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode) (installed by default)\n\nThe first section should be a bulleted list of extensions required to use this recipe. At a minimum, this section should list all additional, non-standard extensions.\n\nIdeally, you should also note which Foam [[recommended-extensions]] are responsible for providing this feature, so any issue reports can be directed to the correct repositories. \n\nWhen creating new recipes, if you don't know which extension does what, you can leave it out.\n\n## Instructions\n\nHere we describe how the extension should be used.\n\n![Demo](assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif)\n\nYou may include a screenshot or GIF of the feature in action by uploading an image to the `assets/images` directory. Please try to keep GIFs as small as possible by recording them with a low frame rate.\n\nThat's pretty much it!\n\n## How to contribute\n\nYou can add [[recipes]] by creating a pull request to [foambubble/foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) on GitHub.\n\nRead more in our [[contribution-guide]]. \n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[recommended-extensions]: recommended-extensions \"Recommended Extensions\"\n[recipes]: recipes \"Recipes\"\n[contribution-guide]: contribution-guide \"Contribution Guide\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"",

They don't need to be built into the core, but may help us design correct solutions:\n\n- Adding and editing page content\n  - [[materialized-backlinks]]\n  - [[link-reference-definitions]] for [[wiki-links]]\n  - [Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)\n- Finding all documents with `#tag`\n- Finding all documents with instances of `[[link]]`\n- Visualisations\n- Full text search\n\n  - Or, if search is too expensive/complex, when given a list of file names and line/column positions from VS Code search API, can return the document context (e.g. full paragraph, preceding/following line etc)\n\n## Collaboration\n\n- This week\n  - List of things to work in order\n  - Provide more vision on future state\n  - Write about working and collaboration philosophy\n  - [[todo]] Prioritise roadmap\n- Week of July 13\n  - Jani is available full time to work on this\n  - Janne: Write proposals, maybe more\n  - Riccardo: Available\n\n## Configuration management\n\n- Other tools may not be able to use vscode\n- [[todo]] Discuss with Janne and Riccardo\n\n## Feature comparison\n\nUseful for knowing what needs to be supported.

You own the information you create with Foam, and you're free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.\n\n<p class=\"announcement\">\n  <b>New!</b> Join <a href=\"https://discord.gg/rtdZKgj\" target=\"_blank\">Foam community Discord</a> for users and contributors!\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"website-only\">\n    <a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/foambubble/foam\" data-icon=\"octicon-star\" data-size=\"large\" data-show-count=\"true\" aria-label=\"Star foambubble/foam on GitHub\">Star</a> \n    <a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template\" data-icon=\"octicon-repo-template\" data-size=\"large\" aria-label=\"Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub\">Use this template</a>\n</div>\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Foam](#foam)\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n  - [How do I use Foam?](#how-do-i-use-foam)\n  - [What's in a Foam?](#whats-in-a-foam)\n  - [Getting started](#getting-started)\n  - [Features](#features)\n  - [Call To Adventure](#call-to-adventure)\n  - [Thanks and attribution](#thanks-and-attribution)\n  - [License](#license)\n\n## How do I use Foam?\n\n**Foam** is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.\n\n![Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features](assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png)\n\nWhether you want to build a [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) or a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/), write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, **Foam** can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:\n\n1. Create a single **Foam** workspace for all your knowledge and research following the [Getting started](#getting-started) guide.\n2. Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them **Bubbles**, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. ([source](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles))\n3. Use Foam's shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with `[[wiki-links]]`, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.\n4. Get an overview of your **Foam** workspace using a [[graph-visualisation]] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [[backlinking]].\n\nFoam is a like a bathtub: _What you get out of it depends on what you put into it._\n\n## What's in a Foam?\n\nLike the soapy suds it's named after, **Foam** is mostly air.\n\n1. The editing experience of **Foam** is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [[recommended-extensions]] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.\n2. To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with [GitHub](http://github.com/).\n3. To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com).\n\n> **Fun fact**: This documentation was researched, written and published using **Foam**.\n\n## Getting started\n\n> ⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.\n\nThese instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.\n\n1. Use the [foam-template project](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) to generate a new repository. If you're logged into GitHub, you can just hit this button:\n\n   <a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate\" data-icon=\"octicon-repo-template\" data-size=\"large\" aria-label=\"Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub\">Use this template</a>\n\n   *If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private, or if you don't want to use GitHub to host your workspace at all, choose **Download as ZIP** instead of **Use this template**.*\n\n2. [Clone the repository locally](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.\n\n    *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item. In VS Code, \"open workspace\" refers to [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).*\n\n3. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)\n\nAfter setting up the repository, open `.vscode/settings.json` and edit, add or remove any settings you'd like for your Foam workspace.\n\nTo learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [[recipes]].\n\nThere are [[known-issues]], and I'm sure, many unknown issues! Please [report them on GitHub](http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues)!\n\n## Features\n\n**Foam** doesn't have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [[recommended-extensions]] you choose to install, but it's up to you to discover what you can do with it!\n\n![Short video of Foam in use](assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif)\n\nHead over to [[recipes]] for some useful patterns and ideas!\n\n## Call To Adventure\n\nThe goal of **Foam** is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.\n\nIt's currently about \"10% ready\" relative to all the features I've thought of, but I've only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I'm excited to learn from others.\n\nI am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.\n\nIf that sounds like something you're interested in, I'd love to have you along on the journey.\n\n- Check out [[roadmap]] to see what's in the plans\n- Read about our [[principles]] to understand Foam's philosophy and direction\n- Read the [[contribution-guide]] guide to learn how to participate.\n- Feel free to open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) to give me feedback and ideas for new features.\n\n## Thanks

      "source": "# Tutorial: Adding a New Command to the VS Code Extension\n\nThis tutorial will walk you through adding a new command to the VS Code extension.\n\nLet's try adding a new command to `foam-vscode`.\n1. Navigate to `packages/foam-vscode/src/extension.ts`\n2. Find the `activate` function\n3. Register a new command:\n\n```diff\nexport function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {\n  context.subscriptions.push(\n    commands.registerCommand(\n      \"foam-vscode.update-wikilinks\",\n      updateReferenceList\n    ),\n+   commands.registerCommand(\n+     \"foam-vscode.hello-friend\",\n+     () => {\n+ .     window.showInformationMessage(\"Hello, friend!);\n+     }\n+   ),\n    workspace.onWillSaveTextDocument(onWillSave),\n    languages.registerCodeLensProvider(\n      mdDocSelector,\n      new WikilinkReferenceCodeLensProvider()\n    )\n  );\n}\n\n```\n4. Navigate to `packages/foam-vscode/package.json`\n5. Add your command to the `contributes.commands` array:\n\n```diff\n\"contributes\": {\n    \"commands\": [\n      {\n        \"command\": \"foam-vscode.update-wikilinks\",\n        \"title\": \"Foam: Update Markdown Reference List\"\n+     },\n+     {\n+       \"command\": \"foam-vscode.hello-friend\",\n+       \"title\": \"Foam: Hello Friend\",\n+     },\n    ]\n  },\n```\n6. Press f5 to run the new extension host, or restart the extension host if it's already running.\n7. Test out your new command. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and select \"Foam: Hello Friend\". You should see an information pop up in the corner of the screen.\n\nAnd that's how you add new commands! We look forward to your contributions.\n\nMore resources:\n- [Your First Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)\n- [`vscode-extension-samples`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples)\n\n### F.A.Q.\n\n**How do I write a test for my extension addition?**\n\nThis is still a work in progress. We've opted for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as our testing framework. There are currently no end-to-end tests (contributions are welcome!). However, we would encourage you to write tests for anything that you can test. We're happy to discuss on PRs too!\n\n**How do I know if using the local version of the Foam extension vs. the produciton one while testing locally?**\n\nWhen you start the extension development host, the local version of the extension \"shadows\" or overrides any installed versions of the package with the same ID. So when you F5/start the extension host, you should always be running the local version, plus any other extensions your workspace/vscode is configured to run.\n\nAs far as we know, you can't run the \"shadowed\" base install while running the local extension\n",

We could try to write smart solutions, plus a linter for orphans\n\nHow others solve this:\n\n- Unique ids -- could support optionally as part of file name or front matter metadata. Should not be required.\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[todo]: ../todo \"Todo\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n",
